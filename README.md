# GOBLIN_M0D3

> *“A genre-bending, mood-swinging playlist interface built for chaos-loving audio goblins.”*

---

**GOBLIN_M0D3** is an absurdly overgrown, genre-hopping HTML music catalog made for chaotic energy and late-night dopamine dives. Built entirely in a single standalone HTML file, this project houses thousands of tracks pulled from all moods and styles — filtered by genre, linked to Spotify and YouTube, and wrapped in a dark-mode-only UI because light mode is for cowards.

---

### ✨ Features

- 🎧 **“ALL!” View**: Browse the full tracklist in one massive scroll.
- 🎸 **Genre Tabs**: Navigate instantly between moods and styles.
- 🌗 **Dark Mode Forever**: Light mode triggers an aggressive hiss.
- 🔗 **Integrated**: Every song links directly to Spotify and YouTube.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on desktop, phone, or eldritch tablet.
- 🔒 **No Backend**: Just raw HTML + CSS in one file. No cookies, no trackers, just vibes.
